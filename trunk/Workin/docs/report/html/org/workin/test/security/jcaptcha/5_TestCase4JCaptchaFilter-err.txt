少御: Creating a new instance of CacheManager using the diskStorePath "C:\DOCUME~1\Goingmm\LOCALS~1\Temp\/ehcache/workin" which is already used by an existing CacheManager.
The source of the configuration was URL of file:/E:/works/Workin/bin/ehcache/ehcache-hibernate-local.xml.
The diskStore path for this CacheManager will be set to C:\DOCUME~1\Goingmm\LOCALS~1\Temp\/ehcache/workin\ehcache_auto_created_1258346190109.
To avoid this warning consider using the CacheManager factory methods to create a singleton CacheManager or specifying a separate ehcache configuration (ehcache.xml) for each CacheManager instance.
